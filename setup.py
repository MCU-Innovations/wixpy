LONG_DESCRIPTION = '''
WiX.Py is an open source crossplatform alternative for WiX toolset.
Application allows building MSI packages as under MSW and Linux
platforms including inside Docker environment. Unlike WiX/wixl applications
WiX.Py is an JSON-driven builder. To build MSI package you need filling
small JSON file only, describing generic application data (name, version etc.)
