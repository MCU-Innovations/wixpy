# WXS file generation
As it was mentioned before WiX.Py builds WXS model. So application can serialize
(i.e. save) into WXS file format. Just use following command:

```
wix.py --xml_only <your_json_file>.json
```

We have used this option for WiX.PY model debugging. But may be it can be used
for other purposes.
