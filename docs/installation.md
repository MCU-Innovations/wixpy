# WiX.Py installation
We have provided several ways to install WiX.Py depending on system: system 
specific packages, source code and PyPI.

## MS Windows
If you are not familiar with Python, try using WiX.Py MSI package. Installer
contains Python binaries and adds WiX.Py into system PATH. So after installation
WiX.Py will be available as an executable command in command prompt.

Another way is installing Python 2.7 (we recommend to use py2 due to unicode
issues) and run `pip` to install WiX.Py from PyPI:
```
pip install WiX.Py
```
Please note that you need checking availability of your Python installation in 
system PATH. If not, add manually `[Python folder]` and `[Python folder]\Scripts`

Last variant is installing from source code:

* Download WiX.Py source code tarball
* Unpack source code folder somewhere
* Run command `python setup.py install` in source code folder

As for PyPI install, you need installing Python 2.7 and have it in system PATH.

## Linux distributions
For Debian, Ubuntu, LinuxMint and other deb-based distors we are providing ready
deb-packages. WiX.Py has not own native extensions. Therefore all packages are
`noarch`. Major difference for them is a dependency list. For access to libmsi
and libgcab libraries WiX.Py uses gobject introspection. To install WiX.Py 
you need installing libmsi, libgcab, their introspection stubs and python
gobject introspection package. In different distros the packages have different 
naming. If you installing WiX.Py deb-package on non-specified system, you need be
sure that required packages in system repositories have the same naming. You
may find some useful tips in [dependency.py](https://github.com/sk1project/wixpy/blob/master/dependencies.py)
file.

We don't create RPM packages because CentOS has no all required packages in
repositories. Other RPM distros are not used as a build instance usually. But 
you can install WiX.Py on Fedora and OpenSuse 15 from PyPI or from source code. 
Installation steps the same as for MS Windows platform.

## Other UNIX platforms
WiX.Py code is a pure Python code. So you could install it anywhere if you 
have Python installed. But you need installing libmsi, libgcab, their 
introspection stubs and python gobject introspection package. For example,
on macOS you could try using `brew install msitools` to install libmsi and 
libgcab. The issue is rather theoretical because there is no practical sense
for that.
